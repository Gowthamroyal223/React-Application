EXPLANATION:
************
This SQL snippet creates a table named customers with columns sno, customer_name, age, phone, location, and created_at.
Populate the database with 50 dummy records:
This is a manual step where you would insert dummy data into the customers table using SQL INSERT statements.

Set up the backend server (server.js)
------------------------------------------
It imports required modules (express, sequelize) and sets up an instance of the Express app.
The Sequelize instance is initialized to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
A Sequelize model Customer is defined to represent the customers table.
An Express route (GET /api/customers) is created to handle requests for fetching customer data.
It accepts query parameters for pagination (page), search (search), and sorting (sortBy).
It uses Sequelize's findAndCountAll method to fetch paginated and filtered data from the database based on the query parameters.
The retrieved data is sent back as a JSON response.
Creating a GitHub repository:
-------------------------------
Push the backend and frontend code to separate directories in a GitHub repository.
Ensure that the README.md file includes instructions on how to set up and run the project.

*******************************************************************

README.md
----------
Set up a Node.js project with framework:
Set up routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
Install Sequelize and PostgreSQL driver.
************************************************
Create an endpoint to create 50 records with dummy data.
Create an endpoint to retrieve paginated records.
Implement search functionality to filter records by name or location.
Implement sorting functionality by date or time.
Frontend (React)
Set up a React project:
Create a new React project using create-react-app or any other method of your choice.
Create components:
Create a component to display the table with records.
Implement a pagination component to navigate through pages.
Display data in table format:
Add options for sorting records by date or time.
Send sorting criteria to the backend and update the UI with sorted results.

ReactJS
***********
React is an open source, JavaScript library for developing user interface (UI) in web application. React is developed and released by Facebook in 2013. 
Facebook is continuously working on the React library and enhancing it by fixing bugs and introducing new features.
ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs) and dynamic web applications.
React allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage their state efficiently.
Applications:
************
 	Facebook, popular social media application 
 	Instagram, popular photo sharing application
 	Netflix, popular media streaming application
 	Code Academy, popular online training application
 	Reddit, popular content sharing application
PostgreSQL
**********
PostgreSQL (pronounced as post-gress-Q-L) is an open source relational database management system (DBMS) developed by a worldwide team of volunteers. PostgreSQL is not controlled by any corporation or other private entity and the source code is available free of charge.
Nodejs
********
Node.js is a very powerful JavaScript-based platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript V8 Engine. It is used to develop I/O intensive web applications like video streaming sites, single-page applications, and other web applications. Node.js is open source, completely free, and used by thousands of developers around the world.

Step 1: Set up the Node.js server
Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm:


mkdir react-node-postgres-app
cd react-node-postgres-app
npm init -y
Install necessary dependencies:


npm install express pg
Create the main server file server.js:

javascript

// server.js

const express = require('express');
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'your_username',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'your_database_name',
  password: 'your_password',
  port: 5432,
});

const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Server is running');
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(Server running on port ${PORT}));
This sets up a basic Express server that listens on port 5000 and connects to your PostgreSQL database.

Step 2: Set up PostgreSQL Database
You need to have PostgreSQL installed on your machine. Create a database and a table for our application.

Connect to PostgreSQL:


psql -U your_username -d your_database_name
Create the customers table:

sql

CREATE TABLE customers (
  sno SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  age INT,
  phone VARCHAR(20),
  location VARCHAR(100),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Step 3: Insert Dummy Data
Insert 50 dummy records into the customers table:

sql

INSERT INTO customers (customer_name, age, phone, location)
VALUES
  ('John Doe', 30, '1234567890', 'New York'),
  ('Jane Smith', 25, '0987654321', 'Los Angeles'),
  -- Add 48 more records here...
;
Step 4: Set up React Frontend
Create a new React app using Create React App:


npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
Install necessary dependencies:


npm install axios react-table
Create a component to display the customer data:

jsx

// src/components/CustomerTable.js

import React from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';
import { useTable } from 'react-table';

const CustomerTable = () => {
  // Fetch customer data from the server
  const fetchCustomerData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await axios.get('/customers');
      console.log(response.data);
      // Handle response data here
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching customer data:', error);
    }
  };

  // Call fetchCustomerData when component mounts
  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetchCustomerData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Customer Table</h1>
      {/* Display customer data here */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default CustomerTable;
Step 5: Connect Frontend to Backend
Update src/App.js to render the CustomerTable component:

jsx
// src/App.js

import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import CustomerTable from './components/CustomerTable';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <CustomerTable />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Step 6: Run the Application
Start both the frontend and backend servers:

# In the react-node-postgres-app directory
node server.js

# In the frontend directory
npm start
This should open your browser with the React app running at http://localhost:3000/ and your Node.js server running at http://localhost:5000/.

This is a basic setup to get you started. You'll need to implement functionality for fetching, displaying, searching, and sorting the customer data in the React frontend, as well as creating appropriate API endpoints in the Node.js backend to handle these actions. Let me know if you need further assistance with any specific part!
